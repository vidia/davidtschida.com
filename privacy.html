            I get questions about privacy and security tactics a lot, so I created this page to point people to for links and resources. However, I want to make something clear. <strong>I am not an expert.</strong> What I recommend here is based on my
            threat model and my own needs. I try to not give bad advice, but I am not perfect.

            I've broken this into two primary sections. The first, a series of links for doing your own research
            and second, at the bottom, some of my direct recommendations.

                    A lot of people have asked me what VPN I use. Right now I use PIA, a US based VPN provider that has
                    a strict no logging
                    policy. I have had good luck with them so far, but they ARE a US based company.
                    <a href="https://privacytoolsio.github.io/privacytools.io/#ukusa">So if that concerns you</a>, then
                    use the
                    links above, especially "That One Privacy Site", to choose your own VPN that fits your needs. No

                  <p>Note: In the time since I originnally wrote this, PIA has been purchased by another company and there 
                    are concerns that this may undermine their security reputation. Currently I have still decided to use PIA, but keep this in mind when considering a provider.

                    This isn't as much of a privacy suggestion as much as a security one, but often they are tied
                    together. Lastpass is a
                    password manager that lets you have unique, complicated passwords that are different for every
                    single site you visit.
                    I currently use LastPass and it works well for me, but if you are concerned that it is a cloud based
                    service (despite
                    your passwords being encrypted locally before being uploaded), you can look for other options

                    may not be
                    the best option for everyone, but it works for me, and it prevents ads from loading, even on my

                    To get it up you need a Debian based computer that can always be on and accessible, like a Raspberry
